Problem Statement :
Choosing the right crops to grow can be a challenging task, as it requires considering factors like temperature, humidity, and soil type. In todayâ€™s time, farmers grow many crops but they lack the basic knowledge of crops varieties and what type of crops must be suitable for their farms based on temperature, humidity and soil type. This presentation will provide guidance on making informed decisions to maximize crop yields and ensure successful harvests.

# Problems faced by farmers at present:-

Limited access to environmental data
Complexity of crop selection
Risk of suboptimal yield and production
Limited adoption of technology


# Solution Proposed:
Creating a solution for this problem statement  would involve developing a comprehensive  tool or platform that  provides  farmers  with the necessary information and guidance to make informed decisions about which crops to grow on their soil by taking input from the farmers like location and suggesting crops  based on the temperature, humidity and soil of that particular region. Also it recommends  which  fertilizers  and pesticides used for the particular crops .
